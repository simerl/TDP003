ADD/EDIT PROJECTS:
  To add or edit a project you have to edit the data.csv file. CSV means Comma Separated Values which means all 
  values in the file are separated by commas. The first line in the file indicates all the different fields that the 
  data layer can handle. Don't change this. 

  Thereafter comes the projects, one project on each line. Make sure to give the project a name and a number, else it
  won't show on the website.
